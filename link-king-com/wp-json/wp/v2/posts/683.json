At the time, I wasn\u2019t exactly a language prodigy. Sure, I had studied French and Irish in high school, but I wouldn\u2019t describe myself as particularly gifted in language learning. What I did have, however, was plenty of motivation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had fallen in love with a Brazilian woman, now my wife, and was planning to spend a significant amount of time in Brazil. To truly enjoy that time, I needed to speak the language. And to really thrive there, I wanted to speak it well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Early Days: Duolingo and Basic Conversations<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When I began the Portuguese course on Duolingo, I was excited. I believed that if I worked hard enough to complete the course, I\u2019d be fluent by the end. I committed to studying at least 30 minutes a day, often an hour. I completed the course quickly, but to my disappointment, I was far from fluent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could barely hold a one-on-one conversation and constantly needed explanations for words, limited by my small vocabulary. As of September 2023, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5905881\/\">Duolingo\u2019s Portuguese course includes only about 2,855 words<\/a>\u2014not nearly enough for fluency! Worse, many of those words were given minimal focus and inefficient repetition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I first arrived in Brazil, I quickly realized that while Duolingo had helped, it wasn\u2019t the magic solution I\u2019d hoped for. I could hold basic one-on-one conversations if the person I was speaking with was patient enough. Gestures, pointing, and the occasional word guess became my best friends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But let\u2019s be honest\u2014eking out simple sentences gets old fast. Group conversations? Forget about it. If I missed a critical word, I was either an inconvenience or unconsciously left out. Even after completing the course, I realized I needed something more to truly connect with people and thrive in Brazil.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A New Chapter: Discovering the Power of Reading<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what\u2019s the next step in a language learning story when apps aren\u2019t enough? For me, it was reading. I couldn\u2019t find any advanced resources that clicked, so I decided to challenge myself. Reading seemed logical\u2014it lets you go at your own pace and exposes you to countless words in context.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m an avid reader in English, but reading in a second language is a completely different beast. Never one to shy away from a challenge, I picked a book from my list: The Fork, the Witch, and the Worm by Christopher Paolini. At first, I had to look up new words almost every sentence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even in our first language, reading plays a big role in building vocabulary, so why not apply the same principle? I believed that if I wanted to speak Portuguese as well as I speak English, I needed to read\u2014and read a lot. Starting with something I was emotionally connected to, like The Inheritance Cycle, felt like the perfect way to ease into reading in Portuguese.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Struggles and Spreadsheets: My Secret to Retaining Words<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading in Portuguese wasn\u2019t exactly smooth sailing. At first, I\u2019d only manage seven pages a day, translating nearly every sentence. Paolini\u2019s rich vocabulary made it challenging, but the real hurdle was remembering all those new words.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To fix this, I started recording every unfamiliar word I came across in a spreadsheet. Each day, I spent 15 minutes reviewing those words before diving into 45 minutes (or more) of reading. While effective, this system quickly became cumbersome.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make my process more efficient, I wrote macros for the spreadsheet. These simple programs helped me sort words based on when they were last studied and introduced a structured spaced repetition system. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5905881\/\">Here\u2019s an article explaining the science behind spaced repetition<\/a>, which ensures new words are reviewed at just the right intervals to stick. It worked incredibly well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Turning Point: Fluent Reading and Real Progress<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>By the time I reached my third book, my reading speed and confidence had improved dramatically. I had added over 2,000 lemmas to my vocabulary\u2014a lemma being a base word, like \u201crun,\u201d which covers variations like \u201cruns\u201d and \u201crunning.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the time I finished The Inheritance Cycle, I was reading fluently, barely needing to look up words, and sometimes I\u2019d get so into the story I\u2019d read for hours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast forward to today: I\u2019ve completed 11 books in Portuguese and, according to my Kindle, have read over 1.5 million words in the language. Now, I can tackle challenging texts and understand words as obscure as headland (promont\u00f3rio), grimace (careta), and giblets (mi\u00fados).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Building a Better System: The App That Changed Everything<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While my spreadsheet worked well, it wasn\u2019t perfect. Managing hundreds of words manually got overwhelming, so I developed a simple web app. By my third book, I had a tool that streamlined my studies and made vocabulary retention easier than ever.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past year and a half, I\u2019ve used the app to learn over 4,000 new lemmas. It not only reinforced my vocabulary but also allowed me to progress faster than I ever thought possible. My speaking skills have improved immensely, and I can now confidently participate in multiway conversations. I can attend doctor\u2019s appointments with my wife and new baby and understand every word being said with ease.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Lessons Learned: Tips for Your Own Language Learning Story<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re starting your own language learning story, here\u2019s my advice: focus on vocabulary first and worry less about grammar. Learn words in context by reading and listening. Apps like Duolingo are great for beginners, but to truly achieve fluency, you\u2019ll need more tailored tools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s where my app comes in. It\u2019s the system that has made a huge difference in my language learning journey. It\u2019s designed to help you retain vocabulary efficiently through structured spaced repetition\u2014a method proven to enhance learning outcomes. Learn more about the science behind spaced repetition here. The best part? It\u2019s free to download and the best it\u2019s ever been.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion: Try the App for Yourself<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>My language learning story is far from over, but I\u2019ve come a long way\u2014and my app played a huge role in that. Today, I read fluently, engage in conversations with ease, and navigate life in Brazil confidently. If you want to take your own language learning to the next level, give my app a try.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"\/home\">Check out the app on the home page.<\/a> It\u2019s completely free and ready to help you on your journey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My Language Learning Story: How I Went from Basic Words to Fluent in Portuguese My language learning story began in September 2020 at the age of 27.
