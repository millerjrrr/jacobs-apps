It might take time but by the end of that process, they would have gained a much deeper understanding of the grammar and structure of the language. On the other hand, if a student had excellent grammar but a very limited vocabulary (as is often the case), the same book would still be inaccessible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Focusing on vocabulary is also highly efficient. Most of the words in any given sentence are extremely common (e.g., &#8220;he,&#8221; &#8220;she,&#8221; &#8220;it,&#8221; &#8220;the&#8221;), so we avoid unnecessary repetition. With modern technologies, we can easily identify and exclude material the student already knows, enabling them to focus on learning new words quickly and effectively.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite its importance, rapid vocabulary expansion is often overlooked. Excellent resources exist for beginner learners, focusing on grammar and foundational skills, but there are few tools designed specifically for intermediate or advanced learners to accelerate vocabulary growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n<\/div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t<\/div>\n\n<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\n\t\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A Why do we only focus on vocabulary?
